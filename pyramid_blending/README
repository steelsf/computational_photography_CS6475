# Pyramid Blending
WITHOUT using pre-made functions (only using numpy and scipy), this function performs a pyramid blend.
  -It takes the "white" and "black" images and a "mask" and blends them.
  -The belending is performed a different frequency levels (laplace blending) which you can think of as blending the rough patterns, middle pattern, and then find patterns.
  -Many programs do this sort of blending for you, but building it from the ground up gives a deeper understanding (and appreciation!) for the magic that is Photoshop.
  -I took these images and made the black and white mask to demonstrate the code.
